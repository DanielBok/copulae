Copulae package
===============

The Copulae toolbox contains commonly used elliptical and Archimedean copulas.

Future plans are to add more Archimedean and other form of copulas along with goodness-of-fit tests and plots. It's my hope that this package will not only serve as a modeling toolbox, but a pedagogical tool too!
